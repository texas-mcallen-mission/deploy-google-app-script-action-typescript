checklist = """
Things to check for:
Does git-info.js (or TS?) exist yet?  - if not, copy over local version

Does .claspignore exist yet? - if not, create a file, and put /deploy-data in it
    - also just pipe in deploy-data/ in there, it really doesn't matter if it's there twice

Could also stick an empty .gs file in there as a watermark, lol?
